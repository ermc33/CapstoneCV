# CapstoneCV
This Git contains the Computer Vision algorithms developed  for Team RUMarino and the DeepVision Capstone project. 

  - The OldCodes folder is where the first versions of the algorithms and several test cases codes rest in peace. To summon these codes       from the graveyard go ahead and upload them to your computer and run them at your own risk.
